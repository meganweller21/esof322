/**
 * Adventure Game Program Code Copyright (c) 1999-2012 James M. Bieman The
 * Adventure game is based on the "Colossal Cave Adventure" originally designed
 * by Will Crowther and implemented by Will Crowther and Don Wood in Fortran in
 * 1975 and 1976.
 *
 * This micro-version is a variant of the original cave system and is
 * implemented in Java with just a few rooms and with a much more limited
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * Updated August 2010, January 2012 - Code is put into package cs314.a2 to
 * match current CS314 coding standards. Updated January 2012 - Renamed as the
 * "Adventure Game"

/**

 *
 * Room descriptions are followed by a room identifier, to ease debugging and
 * testing. These would be removed to help confuse the user, which is our
 * ultimate aim.
 *
 * I haven't added all of the room descriptions. They will be done later.

 * In this version all I/O is through standard I/O; I/O is to and from the
