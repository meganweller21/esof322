Ashley Bertrand and Megan Weller

Ashley:
My main responsibilities in this assignment were to implement the functionality for grab() and drop().  
One of the hardest parts of the assignment was having to jump into a bunch of code that I was not familiar 
with (because I didn't write it), and then making sense of all the class relationships.  At times, I found 
it difficult trying to maintain the model/view separation for displaying the messages in accordance with 
the current conditions.

I made a few assumptions regarding the implementation of these methods (which are also listed as comments 
in the code).  If there is more than one item that can be 'grabbed' or 'dropped', the player will grab or 
drop the first one listed.  Also, with regards to the carryingArea display, it will always show what is 
currently being carried, but individual messages (ie. "The room is empty.") do not get updated until the 
next time 'grab' or 'drop' is clicked.
