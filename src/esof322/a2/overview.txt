Ashley Bertrand and Megan Weller

Ashley:
My main responsibilities in this assignment were to implement the functionality for grab() and drop().  
One of the hardest parts of the assignment was having to jump into a bunch of code that I was not familiar 
with (because I didn't write it), and then making sense of all the class relationships.  At times, I found 
it difficult trying to maintain the model/view separation for displaying the messages in accordance with 
the current conditions.  As far as GitHub goes, I'm still having issues with merging.

I made a few assumptions regarding the implementation of these methods (which are also listed as comments 
in the code).  If there is more than one item that can be 'grabbed' or 'dropped', the player will drop the 
first one listed.
