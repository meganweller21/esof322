Team 3: Megan Weller, Ashley Bertrand, and Sheila Tupker

Megan:
I contributed by making the constructor, the scale() method and the equals() method as well as
the unit test for scale() and equals(). I was having problems with the equals() method
and was using AssertEquals(). Ashley helped me solve it so I was able to get it to run
correctly. I was also having issues with opening the demo on d2l and wasn't able to see it.


    Time Spent: 75 minutes at most

Ashley:
I made the add(), dot(), and toString() methods and tests.  The methods were fairly straight forward.
I did have some problems with some of the assert statements until I implemented them using the equals() 
method.  I also had to Google how to write an assertEquals() for a method that returns a double; the 
only difference was I needed to add another parameter.

This was my first experience with Github, so it took a little bit of time figuring out how to clone, pull, 
commit, and push.

I also tried to rename our test package and was not able to, nor was I able to open the demo project on d2l.

    Time Spent: 60 minutes

Sheila:
This was a challenging assignment for me.  

We each had three methods to complete.  

My methods were the following:
negate()
magnitude()
scale()

My experiences: 
GitHub -
I had never used GitHub.  There was a definite learning curve involved with this tool.  

Junit - 
I had never even heard of this tool.  Really amazing tool to compare actual and expected results.  

Vectors - 
I had never worked with vectors before and had no idea Java had a Vector3D to hold data.

Overall - 
Massive learning lesson for me.  Even though we were coding in Java knowing how to code for the vectors and the asserts took some time to figure out.  I like that the code was relatively minimal and it wasnâ€™t too difficult to code once I got the just of what was expected.

     Time spent: 180 minutes
