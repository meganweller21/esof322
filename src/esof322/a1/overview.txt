Team 3: Megan Weller, Ashley Bertrand, and Sheila Tupker

Megan:
I contributed by making the constructor, the scale() method and the equals() method as well as
the unit test for scale() and equals(). I was having problems with the equals() method
and was using AssertEquals(). Ashley helped me solve it so I was able to get it to run
correctly. I was also having issues with opening the demo on d2l and wasn't able to see it.

We also are not able to rename the package for the Vector3DTest. For some reason, the 
rename button is grayed out. Might be a Netbeans issue.

    Time Spent: 75 minutes at most
