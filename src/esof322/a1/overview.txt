Team 3: Megan Weller, Ashley Bertrand, and Sheila Tupker

Megan:
I contributed by making the constructor, the scale() method and the equals() method as well as
the unit test for scale() and equals(). I was having problems with the equals() method
and was using AssertEquals(). Ashley helped me solve it so I was able to get it to run
correctly. I was also having issues with opening the demo on d2l and wasn't able to see it.

We also are not able to rename the package for the Vector3DTest. For some reason, the 
rename button is grayed out. Might be a Netbeans issue.

    Time Spent: 75 minutes at most

Ashley:
I made the add(), dot(), and toString() methods and tests.  The methods were fairly straight forward.
I did have some problems with some of the assert statements until I implemented them using the equals() 
method.  I also had to Google how to write an assertEquals() for a method that returns a double; the 
only difference was I needed to add another parameter.

This was my first experience with Github, so it took a little bit of time figuring out how to clone, pull, 
commit, and push.

I also tried to rename our test package and was not able to, nor was I able to open the demo project on d2l.

    Time Spent: 60 minutes
